# About

fpwm is a window manager for X that written with Freepascal and fpGUI. 

This is a fork from http://sourceforge.net/projects/fpwm/ up to r23 where the 
sourceforge fpwm project switched to converting an existing project (wm2) into
pascal.

# Usablility

It compiles and runs, however this absolutely is not ready to be used for
normal use. Alpha at best.

# Requirements

Currently it compiles with the develop branch of fpgui, the branch that 
switched over to "alienwindows." The latest release of freepaqscal should be 
fine to compile.

# Improvements

I don't expect to spend much time on this in the future however patches are
welcome.
